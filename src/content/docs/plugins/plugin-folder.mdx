import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The folder structure of the plugins folder is designed to organize all
necessary files and libraries required for developing and managing
plugins using the Mint CLI. Below is a detailed breakdown of the various
directories and their purposes.

---

## Working Directory

The **Working Directory** is where the Mint CLI is placed.
This folder contains essential components like the CLI executable,
a data directory for libraries, the plugins directory,
and the `api_key.txt` file used for authentication.

<FileTree>
    - plugins-mint/
        - **mint-cli.exe**  The Mint CLI executable file
        - data/             Directory containing required libraries and tools
        - plugins/          Directory where all plugins are stored
        - api_key.txt       File containing the API key for authentication
</FileTree>

---

## Data Directory

The **Data Directory** holds all the necessary libraries,
the Java Development Kit (JDK), and Minecraft libraries needed
for plugin development. It also includes the plugin template and version information.

<FileTree>
    - data/
        - jdk/
            - java-8/
            - java-17/
            - java-21/
        - libs/
            - Minecraft.jar
            - MintClient.jar
        - template/
        - VERSION.txt
</FileTree>

---

## Plugins Directory

The **Plugins Directory** is where all your active plugins reside.
Every time you download, upload, or work on a plugin using the Mint CLI,
this directory is utilized.

<FileTree>
    - plugins/
        - test-plugin/
        - autofish-plugin/
        - example-plugin/
</FileTree>

## Plugin Folder Structure

Each plugin folder follows a specific structure to ensure it can be
built and run properly. Here’s a breakdown of the structure for an individual plugin:

- The **`.vscode/`** folder contains the Visual Studio Code workspace and
settings for opening and editing the plugin in VS Code.
- The **`plugin.yaml`** file is the configuration file where you can
customize the plugin’s name, description, and visibility.
- The **`src/`** folder contains the Java source code files,
which will be compiled into the actual plugin.

<FileTree>
    - example-plugin/
        - .vscode/
            - settings.json
            - example-plugin.code-workspace
        - **src/**
            - com/
                - example/
                    - ExamplePlugin.java
        - plugin.yaml
</FileTree>

### Key Elements of a Plugin Folder:
1. **.vscode/**: Contains the workspace and settings to configure the plugin for development
in Visual Studio Code.
2. **plugin.yaml**: Defines metadata like the plugin’s name, description, and visibility.
3. **src/**: This is where the actual plugin code is stored, organized in Java packages.
