title: Creating a Plugin
description: A guide on how to create your first plugin using the Mint CLI.

import {Code} from "astro/components";
import {Aside, FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import importedCodeExample from '../../../example.java?raw';
import importedCodeYaml from '../../../plugin.yaml?raw';

This guide will walk you through creating your first plugin using the Mint CLI.
We'll cover the entire process from setting up the plugin structure to
uploading it for use in Mint Client.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have completed the following steps:
- Installed the `mint-cli`.
- Downloaded the necessary libraries.
- Authenticated your `api_key.txt` file.

If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the [installation guide](/plugins/install-cli).

---

## Step 1: Creating a New Plugin

To create a new plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mint-cli plugin create-empty --output <output-folder> --version <1.8.9 | 1.18.2 | 1.20.6>
```

In this example, we'll replace `<output-folder>` with `my-first-plugin`
and set the `<version>` to `1.8.9`:

```bash
mint-cli plugin create-empty --output my-first-plugin --version 1.8.9
```

This command creates a new plugin in the `plugins/` directory,
generating the following folder structure:

<FileTree>
    - my-first-plugin/
        - .vscode/
            - settings.json
            - my-first-plugin.code-workspace
        - src/
            - com/
                - example/
                    - Example.java
        - plugin.yaml
</FileTree>

---

## Step 2: Importing the Project into Your IDE

To work on your plugin with full IntelliSense and debugging support,
import the project into Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. From the **File** menu, select **Open Workspace from File...**.
3. Navigate to the `my-first-plugin` folder.
4. Select the `my-first-plugin.code-workspace` file from the `.vscode/` folder.
5. Click **Open** to load the project.

This will configure VS Code with the necessary settings and workspace for your plugin.

---

## Step 3: Editing the Plugin

Now that your project is open in VS Code, you can begin editing the plugin.
The main file youâ€™ll work with is `Example.java` located in the `src/com/example/`
directory.

### Entry Point of a Plugin

Every plugin requires an entry point, which is a class that implements the `IPlugin`
interface. This interface includes two key methods:
- `onEnable`: This is called when the plugin is enabled.
- `onDisable`: This is called when the plugin is disabled.

You can only have one class in your plugin that implements the `IPlugin` interface.

<Code type={"code"} lang="java" title={"Example.java"} code={importedCodeExample}/>

In the provided example, the plugin registers and unregisters a client tick listener,
printing "ClientTickEvent" on every tick.

Feel free to modify this file to fit the behavior you want your plugin to have.
You can also create additional Java classes and packages as needed for more
complex functionality.

---

## Step 4: Configuring the Plugin

The `plugin.yaml` file contains important metadata about your plugin,
including its name, description, version, and visibility.

### Key Fields in `plugin.yaml`:
- **id**: Automatically generated when you upload the plugin (leave it blank initially).
- **public**: Controls the visibility of the plugin.
- **version**: Automatically updated; do not manually change this.

<Code type={"code"} lang="yaml" title={"plugin.yaml"} code={importedCodeYaml}/>

You shouldn't edit the `id`, `public`, or `version` fields.
The `id` field will remain `null` until the plugin is uploaded.

---

## Step 5: Uploading the Plugin

Once your plugin is ready, upload it to the Mint Client by running the following command:

```bash
mint-cli plugin upload --folder <folder>
```

In this case, replace `<folder>` with the name of your plugin folder, e.g., `my-first-plugin`:

```bash
mint-cli plugin upload --folder my-first-plugin
```

### Troubleshooting Uploads:
- If the upload fails, the CLI will provide error messages indicating what needs
to be fixed (such as code errors or configuration issues).
- If the upload succeeds, you'll receive a confirmation message with the plugin's ID.

## Step 6: Using the Plugin In-Game

Once the plugin is uploaded, you can use it in the Mint Client. Here's how:

1. Open the Mint Client and navigate to the **Plugins** tab.
2. Your plugin will be listed there. If it's not visible, click the **Refresh**
button to reload all plugins (this will also disable and unload currently running plugins).
3. After refreshing, you will see your plugin. Click the **Download** button to
load it into the game.
4. From there, you can enable and disable the plugin as needed using
the Mint Client GUI.

<Aside type="danger">
    Be cautious when running plugins from unknown sources.
    Plugins can execute code on your computer,
    and malicious plugins can compromise your security. Only run code you trust.

## Summary

By following these steps, you've learned how to create,
configure, and upload a basic plugin using the Mint CLI.
With this foundation, you're ready to start building
more complex plugins and exploring the full capabilities
of the Mint Client. Always remember to test your plugins
thoroughly and manage their configuration carefully in
the `plugin.yaml` file.
