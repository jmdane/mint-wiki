Events are a way to listen to specific actions that happen in the game.
They are used to trigger specific actions when something happens in the game.

---
## Listening to events

To listen to an event, you need to register a listener for that event.
This is done by registering an object with the PluginManager Event Bus.
It is recommended to do this in the `onEnable` method of your plugin.
And unregister the listener in the `onDisable` method in the entrypoint of
your plugin that inherits from `IPlugin`.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"event-listener.java"} code={`@Override
public void onEnable() {
    PluginManager.getInstance().getEventBus().register(this);
}

@Override
public void onDisable() {
    PluginManager.getInstance().getEventBus().unregister(this);
}`}/>

The way event listening works is that the listener class has methods that are annotated with `@Subscribe`.
And the parameter of the method is the event class that you want to listen to.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"event-listener.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void OnEvent(EventClassHere event) {
    // Do something
}`}/>

Remember to replace `EventClassHere` with the event class you want to listen to.

## ClientTickEvent

The `ClientTickEvent` is an event that is fired every tick of the client.
This event is useful for doing things that need to be done every tick.
It is located in the `com.originmint.plugin.events.ClientTickEvent` class.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"client-tick-event.java"} code={`@Subscribe
public void onClientTick(ClientTickEvent event) {
    // Do something every tick
}`}/>

It has two phases:
- `PRE`: Fired at the beginning of the tick.
- `POST`: Fired at the end of the tick.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"client-tick-event.java"} code={`@Subscribe
    public void onClientTick(ClientTickEvent event) {
        if (event.phase == ClientTickEvent.Phase.PRE) {
            // Do something at the beginning of the tick
        } else if (event.phase == ClientTickEvent.Phase.POST) {
            // Do something at the end of the tick
        }
    }`}/>

---

## KeyInputEvent

The `KeyInputEvent` is an event that is fired when a key is pressed or released.
This event is useful for listening to key presses.
It is located in the `com.originmint.plugin.events.KeyInputEvent` class.
This is for any key and does not contain the key code of the key that was pressed.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"key-input-event.java"} code={`
KeyBinding keyBinding = new KeyBinding("key", 54, "category");

@Subscribe
public void onKeyInput(KeyInputEvent event) {
    // Any Key was pressed or released
    if(keyBinding.isPressed()) {
        // Do something, RSHIFT was pressed
    }
}`}/>

---

## RenderTickEvent

The `RenderTickEvent` is an event that is fired every tick of the render loop.
This event is useful for doing things that need to be done every render tick.
It is located in the `com.originmint.plugin.events.RenderTickEvent` class.
It also has multiple types:
- `PRE`: Fired at the beginning of the render tick.
- `GUI`: Fired when the GUI is rendered.
- `OVERLAY`: Fired when the overlay is rendered.
- `WORLD`: Fired when the world is rendered.
- `POST`: Fired at the end of the render tick.

This can be useful to render something as a GUI, or something in the world such as tracers or esp.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"render-tick-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onRenderTick(RenderTickEvent event) {
    if (event.type == RenderTickEvent.Type.PRE) {
        // Do something at the beginning of the render tick
    } else if (event.type == RenderTickEvent.Type.POST) {
        // Do something at the end of the render tick
    } else if (event.type == RenderTickEvent.Type.GUI) {
        // Do something when the GUI is rendered
    } else if (event.type == RenderTickEvent.Type.OVERLAY) {
        // Do something when the overlay is rendered
    } else if (event.type == RenderTickEvent.Type.WORLD) {
        // Do something when the world is rendered
    }
}`}/>

---

## Packet Event

Listening to packets is different than other events, it is using the vanilla packet classes
located at `net.minecraft.network.play.client` and `net.minecraft.network.play.server`.
This is useful for listening to packets that are sent or received by the client.
You also have to have two parameters in the method, the packet class you want to listen to
and the `PacketCallback` class located at `com.originmint.plugin.events.PacketCallback`.
The packet callback is used to cancel the packet if needed.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"packet-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onPacket(Packet<?> packet, PacketCallback callback) {
    // Listen to all packets
}`}/>

You can also listen to specific packets by specifying the class, for example listening to chat.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"packet-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onPacket(S02PacketChat packet, PacketCallback callback) {
    // Listen to chat packets
    // Cancel received chat packets
    callback.cancel();
}`}/>

---

## ReplayEvent

The `ReplayEvent` is an event that is fired when a replay is started, stopped or paused.
This is a custom event that is fired by the replay system.
It is located in the `com.originmint.plugin.events.ReplayEvent` class.

The different types of the replay event are:
- `START`: Fired when the replay starts.
- `STOP`: Fired when the replay stops.
- `PAUSE`: Fired when the replay is paused.
- `RESUME`: Fired when the replay is resumed.
- `FINISH`: Fired when the replay finishes.

It also has two phases:
- `PRE`: Fired at the beginning of the replay event.
- `POST`: Fired at the end of the replay event.

This can be useful to do something when the replay starts, stops, or pauses.
And you can also cancel starting, stopping, or pausing the replay.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"replay-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onReplay(ReplayEvent event) {
    if (event.type == ReplayEvent.Type.START) {
        // Do something when the replay starts
    } else if (event.type == ReplayEvent.Type.STOP) {
        // Do something when the replay stops
    } else if (event.type == ReplayEvent.Type.PAUSE) {
        // Do something when the replay is paused
    } else if (event.type == ReplayEvent.Type.RESUME) {
        // Do something when the replay is resumed
    } else if (event.type == ReplayEvent.Type.FINISH) {
        // Do something when the replay finishes
    }
}`}/>

Example of cancelling the replay start:

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"replay-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onReplay(ReplayEvent event) {
    if (event.type == ReplayEvent.Type.START && event.phase == ReplayEvent.Phase.PRE) {
        // Cancel starting the replay
        event.cancelEvent();
    }
}`}/>

## SyncEvent

The `SyncEvent` is an event that is fired when the replay goes out of sync.
This is a custom event that is fired by the replay system.
It is located in the `com.originmint.plugin.events.SyncEvent` class.
This can be used to do something when the replay goes out of sync.
Or cancel the replay from going out of sync.

There are different types of the sync event:
- `CAMERA`: Fired when the camera goes out of sync.
- `POSITION`: Fired when the position goes out of sync.
- `LOCK_POSITION`: Fired when the client gets moved by the server.
- `INVENTORY`: Fired when the inventory goes out of sync.
- `INVENTORY_ERROR`: Fired when an error occurs with the inventory.
- `INVENTORY_OPEN`: Fired when the inventory is opened.
- `INVENTORY_OPEN_CONTAINER`: Fired when the container is opened.
- `INVENTORY_HOTBAR`: Fired when the hotbar goes out of sync.
- `INVENTORY_SLOT`: Fired when a slot goes out of sync.
- `INVENTORY_ARMOR`: Fired when the armor goes out of sync.

It also has two phases:
- `PRE`: Fired at the beginning of the sync event.
- `POST`: Fired at the end of the sync event.

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"sync-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onSync(SyncEvent event) {
    if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.CAMERA) {
        // Do something when the camera goes out of sync
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.POSITION) {
        // Do something when the position goes out of sync
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.LOCK_POSITION) {
        // Do something when the client gets moved by the server
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY) {
        // Do something when the inventory goes out of sync
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY_ERROR) {
        // Do something when an error occurs with the inventory
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY_OPEN) {
        // Do something when the inventory is opened
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY_OPEN_CONTAINER) {
        // Do something when the container is opened
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY_HOTBAR) {
        // Do something when the hotbar goes out of sync
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY_SLOT) {
        // Do something when a slot goes out of sync
    } else if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.INVENTORY_ARMOR) {
        // Do something when the armor goes out of sync
    }
}`}/>

Example of cancelling the camera going out of sync:

<Code type={"code"} lang={"java"} title={"sync-event.java"} code={`
@Subscribe
public void onSync(SyncEvent event) {
    if (event.type == SyncEvent.Type.CAMERA && event.phase == SyncEvent.Phase.PRE) {
        // Cancel the camera from going out of sync
        event.cancelEvent();
    }
}`}/>

This will keep calling every tick until the camera is back in sync. So you have to keep
that in mind when cancelling the event.
